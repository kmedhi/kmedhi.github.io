I am a Political Scientist specializing in social movements, human rights, and transnational politics. Currently, I serve as a visiting assistant professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I also completed my Ph.D. in political science and my M.S. in social data analytics and research. My research examines the dynamics of protest movements, political repression, and policy outcomes, focusing on transnational cooperation and human rights. My recent work on transnational repression, published in International Studies Quarterly, received the 2024 International Studies Association Best Human Rights Paper Award.

My research agenda spans multiple areas, including protest campaign fragmentation, social movements in India, public health policy in autocracies, and maternal health initiatives in Madhya Pradesh. I employ both quantitative and qualitative methods, from statistical analysis of large-scale datasets to in-depth fieldwork in diverse international contexts. Before my doctoral studies, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Institute for Research on India and International Studies in Delhi, where I contributed to projects examining global knowledge production and international relations.

But there's more to life than research questions! I spend my weekends at Operation Kindness animal shelter, where every tail wag reminds me why community engagement matters. My cat Emily (a proud Operation Kindness alumna) supervises my work from home, occasionally contributing to my research by walking across my keyboard. When I need a break from thinking about politics, I lose myself in Hindustani classical music - though I'm still working on convincing Emily to appreciate my singing. I believe that understanding politics helps us build kinder, more inclusive communities - one research project, one classroom discussion, and one shelter volunteer shift at a time.
