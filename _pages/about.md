I am a graduate student of political science in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas. Prior to that, I was a Research Assistant in the Institute of Research on India and International Studies, Gurgaon, India. I spent several memorable years at Miranda House, University of Delhi from where I graduated with a bachelors and a masters degree in Political Science from the department of Political Science.

My recent research projects focus on mass protests, political propaganda, political violence and human rights. I am advised by [Anton Sobolev](https://asobolev.com/), [Rebecca Cordell](http://www.rebeccacordell.com/) and [Jennifer Holmes](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jholmes/).
