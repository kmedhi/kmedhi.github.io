I am a graduate student of political science in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas. Prior to that, I was a Research Assistant in the Institute of Research on India and International Studies, Gurgaon, India. I spent several memorable years at Miranda House, University of Delhi from where I graduated with a bachelors and a masters degree in Political Science from the department of Political Science.

My recent research projects focus on mass protests, political propaganda, political violence and human rights. I am advised by [Anton Sobolev](https://asobolev.com/), [Rebecca Cordell](http://www.rebeccacordell.com/) and [Jennifer Holmes](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jholmes/). 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
