<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a graduate student of political science in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas. My recent research projects focus on mass protests, political propaganda, political violence and human rights. I am advised by <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jholmes/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jennifer Holmes</a>, <a href="http://www.rebeccacordell.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rebecca Cordell</a> and <a href="https://asobolev.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Anton Sobolev</a>.</p> <p>My foundation in political science was solidified during my formative years at Miranda House, University of Delhi. Here, I was fortunate to earn both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Political Science. Prior to my current endeavors, I served as a Research Assistant at the Institute of Research on India and International Studies in Gurgaon, India, where I delved deep into varied aspects of politics and policy.</p> <p>While academia plays a pivotal role in my life, I find solace and expression through music. I’m a trained classical singer in the Hindustani classical tradition, having accomplished my Visharad in vocal music from the Bhatkhande Institute. Each raga, to me, tells a story that resonates deeply with the human experience. In those moments when I step away from my research and music, I immerse myself in the comforting world of books, and the intricate crafts of knitting and crochet. I also cherish every moment spent with my adorable cat, Emily.</p> </body></html>
